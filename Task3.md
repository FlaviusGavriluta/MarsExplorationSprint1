# Open/Closed Principle
We will design classes and modules so that they are open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that we can add new functionality without modifying the existing code.

# Single Responsibility Principle
Each class or module will have a single responsibility. This simplifies development and maintenance.

# Interface Segregation Principle
We will avoid creating overly complex interfaces by dividing them into smaller, more specific groups.

# Dependency Injection
By injecting dependencies, we can decouple components and make code testing and reuse easier.

# Working with Multidimensional Arrays
We will use arrays to represent the map, with complex objects such as mountains and pits.

# Random Generation
We will use random generation to place objects on the map, according to the requirements.

# Data-Driven Testing
We will create tests that rely on data sets to verify the correctness and robustness of the solution.

# Working with File I/O
We will write and read configuration data and results from and into files.
