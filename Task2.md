## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
This principle states that classes, modules, and functions should be open for extension but closed for modification. In your case, this means you can add new types of elements to the map without modifying the existing code.

## Utilizing Multidimensional Arrays
You will need to work with arrays to represent the maps. Some elements, such as mountains and pits, may be multidimensional.

## Working with Random
You will need to place certain elements randomly on the map. This involves using random numbers for coordinates.

## Data-Driven Testing
This involves using a set of input values to test how the code responds to different scenarios.

## Utilizing File I/O
You will need to write to and read from files to save and load the maps.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class or method should have only one responsibility. For example, the `MapConfigurationValidator` class has the responsibility of validating the map configuration.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
This principle involves creating specific interfaces that are tailored to the client's needs. The `CoordinateCalculator` and `DimensionCalculator` interfaces are good examples of this principle.

## Dependency Injection
This involves passing a class's dependencies as arguments rather than creating them inside the class. This allows for greater flexibility and makes testing easier.
